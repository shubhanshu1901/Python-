Python is one of the most popular programming languages.

What is Python?

Python is a Interpreted, Functional and Object Oriented High level Programming Language.

Simple syntax , hence easy to create and maintain python based applications.

It has several build-in libraries or modules which provides the functionality we want

So now , Let's summarize what is Python

Interpreted - very quick as  no compiler and compilation needed step

Its functional as well as it supports all object oriented principles.

/* Don't need this

Functional programming is a programming paradigm in which we try to bind everything in pure mathematical functions style. It is a declarative type of programming style. Its main focus is on “what to solve” in contrast to an imperative style where the main focus is “how to solve”. It uses expressions instead of statements. An expression is evaluated to produce a value whereas a statement is executed to assign variables

Very easy to learn because of it's syntax

Why Python ?

easy to learn and use 
 
performance is super good as interpreted language 

rapid development as it has a lot of inbuild libraries

dynamically typed that is you don't have to specify type of variable

community and third party libraries -  a huge community and easily compatible with third party libraries

Some more pros in pythons -

Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system .

Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.
